Sample environments
===================

| The TXM has been designed to accomodate different kind of *in situ* cells.
| Our X-ray objective lenses are Fresnel Zone Plates (FZP). They have been designed with large diameter in order to offer a comfortable working distance as shown in the table below:

+------------+------------+------------+
|     Δrn    |   Energy   | work. dist.|
+============+============+============+
|    50 nm   |   8 keV    |     59 mm  |
+------------+------------+------------+
|    40 nm   |   8 keV    |     39 mm  |
+------------+------------+------------+
|    30 nm   |   8 keV    |     29 mm  |
+------------+------------+------------+
|    16 nm   |   8 keV    |     16 mm  |

In situ cells for electrochemistry experiments
----------------------------------------------
| Battery cells can be powered through a slip ring placed inside the rotary stage. It means the rotary stage can rotate indefinitely even with electric components plugged over it (see the reen connectors on the Mantis cell pictures below).
| Charge / discharge cycles can be performed with our cycler, a Bio-logic SP150 controlled with the EC-lab software.

Mantis cell
~~~~~~~~~~~
| • A battery coin-cell is being developed *in house* for *operando* measurements (Mark Wolfman). X-ray windows are made of 100 μm thick glassy carbon. While ensuring a good X-ray transmissivity, this material maintains a uniform stack pressure within the cell, allowing the reaction dynamics of the battery material to remain unaffected.

About 30% of X-ray radiation is absorbed by the quartz capillary, carbon wire, and EC/DEC electrolyte at 11.2 keV.

Furnace for *in situ* experiments at high T
-------------------------------------------

| Our furnace is composed of a `MicroFiber Heater FibHeat200_THM_XRD <https://mhi-inc.com/PG4/fiber-heater-microheater.html>`_ able to reach 1900°C. It is enveloped with a Cu cooling socket.
| It is controlled by a `PTC10 controller <https://www.thinksrs.com/products/ptc10.html>`_ integrated with EPICS.

Nano-indenter for *in situ* mechanical testing
----------------------------------------------

| The nano-indenter has been developed by Professor Nik Chawla's group at ASU (Kaira *et al*., 2019 :cite:`kaira2019exploring`). In order to use it, some coordination should be made with this group.
