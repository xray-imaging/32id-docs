The shutter, shown above, uses two galvanometer heads (Cambridge Technologies 6220H), more commonly used in laser scan heads, to rotate a pair of tungsten blades along an axis perpendicular to the X-ray beam. Initally from a state where one galvanometer (1) is closed and the other (2) is open to generate an X-ray pulse the closed galvanometer (1) is opened followed by the closing of (2) after the required amount of delay.
